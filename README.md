# Weather-Dashboard

## Introduction

This app allows users to see weather conditions for cities. Using OpenWeather API, weather data for cities is displayed. The app uses Geocoding API as well as One Call API to get the results by city name then get the lat and lon to build our data.

## Summary

When the page loads the user is presented with a search field where a city name can be entered. The current weather for that city loads showing city name, date, icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index displays a color that represents weather conditions in that city (low: green, moderate: yellow, or high: orange). The weather app also displays a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. When clicking a city in search history the user is presented again with current and future conditions for that city.
